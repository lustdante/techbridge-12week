# 4. CSS Introduction

This chapter introduces basics of CSS followed by HTML review.

## HTML Review

- File that ends with .html
- The Skeleton of website
- Consists of `Tags` and `Attributes`
- A complete tag is called `Element`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My first web page</h1>
    <p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## What is CSS?

- Cascading Styles Sheets
- File that ends with .css
- A lot of `{` and `}`

## Why CSS?

- Turns Raw HTML into Styled HTML
- It's like a flesh for your website. It CANNOT exist without HTML, just as flesh cannot exist without skeleton.
- Just like flesh, it's all about how it looks.
- *Use Firefox demo to switch between styles*

## Syntax

This is how CSS looks like.

```
(Selector) {
  (Property): (Value);
  (Property): (Value);
  (Property): (Value);
  ...
}
```

A sample css style looks like this.

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

## Applying CSS
There are **3 ways** to attach CSS to HTML.

### Inline

```html
<p style="color: red">I am red.</p>
```

- Using **style** `attribute` on the `Element`.
- The quickest way but only limited to one element.
- Used for *quick and dirty debugging.*

### Internal

```html
<style>
    p {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
<p>Hello, I'm red, too.</p>
```

- Using **style** `tag` to define css statement.
- Fairly quick and more flexible than inline.
- Used for *quick and dirty implementation.*

### External

```css
/* style.css */
p {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p>I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm red, too.</p>
</body>
```

- Using separate .css file and using **link** `element` to load the file.
- It's the flexible and clean.
- This is what we are going to use from now on.

> Whenever you start building your website, be sure to have the followings prepared.

1. Create index.html
2. Create style.css
3. Add `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`

## Basic Styling Technique - Color

The most primitive way to apply style is coloring.

```html
<h1>My first web page</h1>

<h2>What this is</h2>
<p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>

<h2>Why this is</h2>
<p>To learn HTML</p>
```

Let's make that colorful!

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
h2 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: green;
}
```

## Basic Styling Technique - Text

Let's change font family, font size, and text decoration.

### Font size

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 48px;
}
h2 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

### Font Family

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 48px;
  font-family: Verdana;
}
h2 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: Courier;
}
p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: Times;
}
```

Here are the list of frequently used font families.

- Arial
- Courier
- Georgia
- "Times New Roman"
- Helvetica
- Tahoma
- Verdana

### Bold, Italic, Underline

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 48px;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
h2 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: Courier;
  font-style: italic;
}
p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: Times;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Selector

So, how do I apply different styles for multiple tags?

```html
<p>I'm an animal</p>
<p>I like fish</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>

<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two (Selected)</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

```css
p {
  color: gray;
}
li {
  color: red;
}
```

What if I want to apply different styles on `<p>Who am I?</p>` and `<li>Two (Selected)</li>`?

```html
<p>I'm an animal</p>
<p>I like fish</p>
<p class="question">Who am I?</p>

<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li class="selected">Two (Selected)</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

```css
.question {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
.selected {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: blue;
}
```

`Class` is a unique attribute meant to describe elements for purposes like styling. The application is endless.

```html
<h1 class="question">Question of the day.</h1>
<p>I'm an animal</p>
<p>I like fish</p>
<p class="question">Who am I?</p>
```

```css
p {
  color: gray;
}
.question {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

This means all `paragraphs` are gray, all `questions` are bold and 14px sized, but `paragraph` that is also a `question` is gray, bold, and 14px sized.

```html
<p>I'm an animal</p>
<p class="underline">I like fish</p>
<p class="question">Who am I?</p>
<p class="question underline">Can I bark?</p>
```

```css
.question {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
.underline {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Pay attention to `<p class="question underline">Can I bark?</p>` and observe how it has style for both `.question` and `.underline`.

> Also discuss styling nested elements

## Three Questions

- Aren't you going to introduce id attribute? ex) <p id="highlight">Today is cold</p>

> Whatever id attribute can do class attribute can do it, too. Let's just use one of them. - A lot of developers

- How do I decide name of class?

> This is a difficult question even for skilled developers. This is what determines good developers and it's mostly experience based.

- At this rate, how am I going to build a fancy website?

> The goal of this course is just to be familiar with how css works. It gets real on next one.
