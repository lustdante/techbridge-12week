# 6. HTML and CSS II

Now that we have text oriented styling and positioning oriented styling, let's get into using html and css to actual making of a website.

## CSS Review

- Ends with .css, has a lot of `{` and `}`
- External script

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```

- CSS Selector

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
.underline {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
.question {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

- Properties for styling text
  + color: (red, #ff0000)
  + font-family
  + font-size
  + font-weight
  + font-style
  + text-decoration

- Properties for element layout
  + width (px, %, auto)
  + height
  + background-color
  + border
  + margin
  + padding
  + text-align

## Little more about Selector

So far, we've discussed three basic ways to select elements.

```html
<p>Answer these questions.</p>
<p class="question">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="question">Who am I? None of your business.</p>
<p id="highlight" class="question">What does a fox say?</p>
```

```css
p {
  font-family: Verdana;
}
.question {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
.underline {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
#highlight {
  color: red;
}
```

We also learned that class can be stacked.

```html
<p class="question">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="question underline">Who am I? None of your business.</p>
```

A typical website is structured as the following.

```html
<div id="section1">
  <div>
    <div>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div id="section2">
  <div>
    <div>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This is like a tree. In fact, `tree` is an official computer science term to describe structures like this.

![DOM Tree](http://watershedcreative.com/naked/img/dom-tree.png)

So, if you want paragraphs in section1 red and paragraphs in section2 yellow, how do you do this?

```html
<div id="section1">
  <div>
    <div>
      <p class="red"></p>
      <p class="red"></p>
      <p class="red"></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div id="section2">
  <div>
    <div>
      <p class="yellow"></p>
      <p class="yellow"></p>
      <p class="yellow"></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This works, but this is very disgusting. How about a way to describe parent and child.

```css
#section1 p {
  color: red;
}
#section2 p {
  color: yellow;
}
```

Placing `whitespace` between selectors describe parent and child relationship. The depth doesn't matter here.

```html
<div id="section1">
  <p>I'm red</p>
  <div>
    <p>I'm red, too!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Don't confuse the ones above with this

```css
div, p {
  font-family: Verdana;
}
```

If depth does matter and if you only want the immediate child, use this.

```css
#section1 > p {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div id="section1">
  <p>I'm red</p>
  <div>
    <p>But I'm not red?!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

There are also many other ways to use selector to do the following.

- Select first child
- Select nth child
- Select element that does NOT have selector
- When hovering

We will introduce them when they are needed.

## Display

We briefly discussed `display` when comparing `div` and `span`. This is one of the core css properties.

- block
  + It can become a box.
  + Won't let anything sit next to it. Takes up the full width.

- inline
  + It cannot become a box.
  + Sits on the same line as another element.

- inline-block
  + It can become a box
  + Sits on the same line as another element.

- none
  + Hidden

## Floating
![Float](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/web-text-wrap.png)
![Float2](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/web-layout.png)

Floating is another core css property that defines layout for many of the websites.

```css
div {
  float: right;
}
```

Pretty much every menu that is stuck at the right side uses `float: right;`.

### The Great Collapse

![Float Collapse](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/collapse.png)

When the parent's children are all floating, the parent collapses.

This [link](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/) has a lot of great explanations.

## Position

Position defines position of the element that cannot be controlled by margin and padding. `static` is the default.

> Position is an intermediate concept that even experienced developer can get confused.

### Absolute

When an element is set to `position: absolute`, it's then positioned in relation to the first parent element it has that doesn't have `position: static`.

If position is absolute, these four css properties become functional.

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}
.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  right: 10px;
}
```

Hmm... what's the best way to describe this. If an element is absolute, it gives up its spot there.

```html
<div class="absolute box"></div>
<div class="box"></div>
<div class="box"></div>
```

### Relative

Relative is more confusing if you describe it. It's like `absolute` where `left` and `top` works, but it doesn't give up its spot just like `absolute` does.

### Fixed

Relative to your screen. Follows you around with scroll.
