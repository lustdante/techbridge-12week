# 10. Python Introduction

This chapter briefly introduces python as a server language.

## What is Python?

Python is currently **the third** most popular languages next to Javascript as the first place followed by Java. It's easy to learn for beginners.

## Two ways to run python code

- Type `python` in Terminal and use it as script mode
- Write python in `script.py` file and run the code using `python script.py`

## How Python will be used for server

You will have bunch of python scripts for your server. When you are done, you will run `python app.py`. The program will continue to run until you force terminate.

## Variable

In programming, you store and manipulate data. That's pretty much all you do. You store your data like the following.

```python
x = 5
```

Number is not the only thing you can store

```python
my_int = 7
my_float = 1.23
my_bool = True
```

After assigning the value, you can reassign again.

```python
x = 5
x = 7
# x is 7 now
```

## Comments

We had `<!-- -->` for html and `/* */` for css. For python it's `#` and `""""""`

```python
# Single line Comment
"""
Multiline comment
"""
```

## Math

Programming Language is like a calculator. That means you can do all the math you like.

```python
addition = 72 + 23
subtraction = 108 - 204
multiplication = 108 * 0.5
division = 108 / 9
exponential = 10 ** 2
modulo = 3 % 2
```

ex) You have meal that cost $44.50 with tax 6.75% and tip for 15%. What's the total?

```python
meal = 44.50
tax = 0.0675
tip = 0.15

meal = meal + meal * tax
total = meal + meal * tip
```

## Strings

Another mostly used data form is string. You can use both single and double quotes.

```python
name = "Ryan"
age = "19"
food = "cheese"
```

## Escaping character

So, if you want to use quote inside the string without closing the string, you escape using `\` backslash.

```python
'There's a snake in my boot!'
```

## String methods

These methods help you manipulate your string

- len()
- lower()
- upper()
- str()

```python
len("PYTHON") # Count length of the string
"PYTHON".lower() # Turn all characters to lower case
"python".upper() # Turn all characters to upper case
str(2) # Turn number 2 into string 2
```

## Print

If you write python script in file, it simply runs without telling you what's going on. Use `print` to output the value in console (terminal)

```python
meal = 44.50
tax = 0.0675
tip = 0.15

meal = meal + meal * tax
print meal
total = meal + meal * tip
print total
```

## Date and Time

So, programming means it can do math and play with words. Can it tell time?

```python
from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now()
print now
print now.year
print now.month
print now.day
```

## Comparator

You can compare two variables to see if it's True or False.

```python

bool_one = 17 < 328 # True
bool_two = 100 == (2 * 50) # True
bool_three = 19 <= 19 # True
bool_four = -22 >= -18 # False
bool_five = 99 != (98 + 1) # False

bool_one = 3 < 5 # True
bool_two = 3 > 5 # False
bool_three = 3 != 5 # True
bool_four = 3 == 5 # False
bool_five = 3 <= 5 # True
```

## And, Or, Not

True and False is False
False and True is False
False and False is False

True or True is True
True or False is True
False or True is True
False or False is False

Not True is False
Not False is True

## Condition

If your program does the exact same thing every time you run it, it won't be much interesting. At some point, you need to do different things when the user entered correct password and entered wrong password.

```python
password = raw_input("Type your password")
correct_password = "zxcvbn"

if password == correct_password:
    print "You are logged in!"
else:
    print "You got your password wrong"
```

Observations
- `if condition:` and `else:`
- indentation is important
- There is also `elif condition:`

## Function

With what you have learned so far, the code you wrote is used only once. That's not really smart. What you want to do is write a reusable code once and use it multiple times.

```python
def tax(bill):
    """Adds 8% tax to a restaurant bill."""
    bill *= 1.08
    print "With tax: %f" % bill
    return bill

def tip(bill):
    """Adds 15% tip to a restaurant bill."""
    bill *= 1.15
    print "With tip: %f" % bill
    return bill

meal_cost = 100
meal_with_tax = tax(meal_cost)
meal_with_tip = tip(meal_with_tax)
```

Observations
- `def function_name(arguments):`
- Indentation also determines beginning and end of functions

How else can we use functions

```python
def square(n):
    """Returns the square of a number."""
    squared = n**2
    print "%d squared is %d." % (n, squared)
    return squared

# Call the square function on line 9! Make sure to
# include the number 10 between the parentheses.

square(2)
square(10)

def power(base, exponent):
    result = base**exponent
    print "%d to the power of %d is %d." % (base, exponent, result)

power(37, 4)
```
## Import

So, since programming language is a calculator, can it do square root?

- Search `python square root` in Google
- Go to the first link
- Discover that it has `math.sqrt(x)`

Awesome. Let's try!

```python
print math.sqrt(25)
```

Then you get the error.

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "python", line 3, in <module>
NameError: name 'math' is not defined
```

But... but... it says I could! Not unless you `import` math *module*.

```python
import math
print math.sqrt(25)
```

Yes, now math exists. Functions like `len()`, `str()` are built-in native. However, not every function made the cut, which is why you have to load it separately.

So, `import math` literally means you brought all math functions. If you only need sqrt function from math, you can do this.

```python
from math import sqrt
print sqrt(25)
```

There are also these math related functions that don't need math module.

```python
max(1, 2, 3) # 3
min(1, 2, 3) # 1
abs(-42) # 42
```

There is also this.

```python
type(1) # <type 'int'>
type(1.1) # <type 'float'>
type("string") # <type 'str'>
```

## List

You've been storing one data at a time. How about a list of data?

```python
zoo_animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth", "lion"];
# One animal is missing!

if len(zoo_animals) > 3:
  	print "The first animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[0]
  	print "The second animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[1]
  	print "The third animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[2]
  	print "The fourth animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[3]
```

You can set the variables in the list like this.

```python
n = [1, 3, 5]
n[1] = n[1] * 5
print(n) # [1, 15, 5]
```

Here is how you append

```python
n = [1, 3, 5]
n.append(4)
print(n) # [1, 3, 5, 4]
```

## Dictionary

```python
# Assigning a dictionary with three key-value pairs to residents:
residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

print residents['Puffin'] # Prints Puffin's room number

# Your code here!
print residents['Sloth']
print residents['Burmese Python']
```

## Interesting Snippets

```python
name = raw_input("What is your name?")
quest = raw_input("What is your quest?")
color = raw_input("What is your favorite color?")

print "Ah, so your name is %s, your quest is %s, " \
"and your favorite color is %s." % (name, quest, color)
```

```python
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()

print '%s/%s/%s %s:%s:%s' % (now.month, now.day, now.year, now.hour, now.minute, now.second)
```

```python
def clinic():
    print "You've just entered the clinic!"
    print "Do you take the door on the left or the right?"
    answer = raw_input("Type left or right and hit 'Enter'.").lower()
    if answer == "left" or answer == "l":
        print "This is the Verbal Abuse Room, you heap of parrot droppings!"
    elif answer == "right" or answer == "r":
        print "Of course this is the Argument Room, I've told you that already!"
    else:
        print "You didn't pick left or right! Try again."
        clinic()

clinic()
```
