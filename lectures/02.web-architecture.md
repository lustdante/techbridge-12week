## Fullstack

Fullstack = Frontend + Backend = Client + Server

- Restaurant analogy
    + You enter the restaurant (You turned on the browser).
    + You look at the menu (You visited the landing page).
    + You ordered something (You clicked something).
    + The order goes to the kitchen (The request is sent to server).
    + Chef takes the order and cooks it up (Server handles the request).
    + Your dinner is served (Server returns response).

## Frontend

- Everything that happens inside your computer.
- It makes **Request** and displays **Response**.
- If you type in an address, you are making a **Request**.
- If you click on a button, you are making another **Request**.
- **Response** is a collection of files with extensions like *.html, *.css, and *.js.
- Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome read these files and show you a nice graphic version.

## Backend

- Everything that happens on the computer thousands of miles away from you.
    + During development, it could happen inside your computer.
- It is a program that is turned on constantly, listening to **Requests**. If it's turned off, the server is down.
- Some server gets 1 or 2 **Request** every minute while Facebook gets 13 Million Queries per second.
