# 3. HTML Introduction

This chapter introduces basics of HTML as the first step to web development.

## What is HTML?

- Hyper Text Markup Language. *Memorize this only if you want to brag it to your friends.*
- File that ends with .html
- A lot of < and >
- Raw HTML looks like this. *Use Firefox demo to apply No Style.*

## Why HTML?

- Because every website you see is made of HTML. Try Chrome's 'View Source' in student suggested page.
- It's like a skeleton of your website. You still need flesh and organ to make it look like a human, but you always start off with skeleton.

## HTML

### Tag

The smallest piece of HTML is anything you write.

```
Anything
```

Most of the times, it's wrapped by something called **Tag**.

```html
<Tag>Anything</Tag>
```

A website has a lot of this. A LOT.

```html
<Tag>Something</Tag>
<Tag>Anything</Tag>
<Tag>This thing</Tag>
```

Tag can have multiple depth.

```html
<Tag>
  <Tag>Something</Tag>
  <Tag>Anything</Tag>
  <Tag>This thing</Tag>
</Tag>
```

Multiple depth means infinite depth!

```html
<Tag>
  <Tag>
    <Tag>One</Tag>
    <Tag>Two</Tag>
    <Tag>Three</Tag>
  </Tag>
  <Tag>
    <Tag>Inception</Tag>
    <Tag>
      <Tag>
        <Tag>We can go deeper</Tag>
      </Tag>
    </Tag>
  </Tag>
  <Tag>This thing</Tag>
</Tag>
```

### Attributes

Tags can have **attributes** inside.

```html
<Tag attribute>Anything</Tag>
```

Attributes look like this.

```html
one="two"
name="techbridge"
value="Tech Bridge"
```

Therefore,

```html
<Tag one="two">Something</Tag>
<Tag name="techbridge">Anything</Tag>
<Tag value="Tech Bridge">This thing</Tag>
```

Tag can have multiple attributes.

```html
<Tag one="two" name="techbridge" value="Tech Bridge">
  Something
</Tag>
```

Tags have name. A lot of names.

```html
<html></html>
<head></head>
<body></body>
<title></title>
<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<b></b>
<i></i>
<div></div>
<span></span>
```

In fact, there are so many of them that sometimes you need to search on your own.

### Basic Tags

Don't worry, because you only need to know some of them to make a website. For instance,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>
<body>
    This is my first web page
</body>
</html>
```

Every website starts with this **HTML Tag**. Everything you see goes inside **Body tag**. **Head tag** is like configuration like setting **Title Tag**. We will get into more of that later.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>
<body>
    This is my first web page
    How exciting
</body>
</html>
```

Umm, that doesn't look right. Body tag doesn't care about **newline**. You need **Paragraph Tag**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is my first web page</p>
    <p>How exciting</p>
</body>
</html>
```

If you need to write something long, 9 out of 10 it belongs to **Paragraph Tag**.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>My first web page</h1>

    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>

    <h2>Why this is</h2>
    <p>To learn HTML</p>
</body>

</html>
```

Where there is content, there is **Header Tag**. Notice that landing page demo shown earlier? The biggest text you see uses **Header Tag**.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>My first web page</h1>

    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>

    <h2>Why this is</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To learn HTML</li>
        <li>To show off</li>
        <li>Because I've fallen in love with my computer and want to give her some HTML loving.</li>
    </ul>

</body>

</html>
```

If you need to list something, you can use **Unordered List Tag** and **List Item Tag**. Also try out **Ordered List Tag**

By the way, do you know what's special about HTML? It can **link** to other page. If you search League of Legends on Google, you can click the link and go to the website. If you click Sign up page, it links you to Sign up page. All these are possible thanks to this guy.

```html
<a></a>
```

It's called **Anchor Tag**. Complete version looks like this.

```html
<a href="http://www.htmldog.com">HTML Dog</a>
```

When you build your own website, you are going to have many html files. ex) index.html, signup.html, signin.html. **Anchor Tag** lets you *surf* to all these pages.

Now, all we dealt with are bunch of texts. How about some memes to light up your website?

```html
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yQWZag7.gif">
```

10% of an average website uses tags mentioned above. 90% of them are all about these two.

```html
<div></div>
<span></span>
```

What is **Div Tag** and **Span Tag**? Well, you gotta try them out!

```html
<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
<div>3</div>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
```

They are doing something, but what exactly?

*(Describe this using whiteboard)*
*(Also describe how divs and spans pile up)*
