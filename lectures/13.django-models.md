# 13. Django Model

This chapter introduces Django Model along with object and python class.

## Python Review

Here are the list of python concepts we have learned so far.

- Variable
- Math
- String
- Comparator
- Condition
- Function
- Import

Using all these, you can write a code like this.

```python
from datetime import datetime

def clinic():
    now = datetime.now()
    print "Today is %s/%s" % (now.month, now.day)
    print "You've just entered the clinic!"
    print "Do you take the door on the left or the right?"
    answer = raw_input("Type left or right and hit 'Enter'.").lower()
    if answer == "left" or answer == "l":
        print "This is the Verbal Abuse Room, you heap of parrot droppings!"
    elif answer == "right" or answer == "r":
        print "Of course this is the Argument Room, I've told you that already!"
    else:
        print "You didn't pick left or right! Try again."
        clinic()

clinic()
```

However, power of programming language does not stop here.

## Database

Before we begin, there is an additional layer you should consider when creating a website. Database.

When you sign up to a website, your e-mail, username, and password are saved in there for very long time. This is not like regular programming code that resets every time you run the code.

This means your user data needs to be saved somewhere `persistent`. It means it needs to be saved inside `database`.

As you see from the sample database, you can see it consists of tables where each table has multiple data in there.

Each table can be considered as an object.

## Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

In short, you can define a dog as an object. A dog has
- name
- breed
- age
- owner

Under these definitions, you can have a dog named `Coco` and `Bomi`.

![Coco](http://i.imgur.com/1pUD554.png)
The `attributes` for `Coco` are the following:
- name: `Coco`
- breed: `Maltese`
- age: `2`
- owner: `Eric`

![Nana](http://i.imgur.com/DFFtBbV.jpg)
- name: `Bomi`
- breed: `poodle`
- age: `5`
- owner: `Theo`

That's pretty much the core of object oriented programming. This is achieved using `class`.

## Class Syntax

A class is a way of organizing and producing objects with similar `attributes`. A simple class looks like this.

```python
class NewClass(object):
    # Class magic here
```

We can go deeper with class, but it isn't necessary in order to model with Django.

## Django Model

To replicate the above dog model in Django, it will be the following:

```python
from django.db import models

class Dog(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    breed = models.TextField()
    age = models.IntegerField()
    owner = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
```

It might be a lot to take in at a moment, but it only needs few explanations.

- `class Dog(models.Model)` looks like `class NewClass(object)` but with custom name and `model.Model` instead of `object`. There can be many type of classes, but this is Django Model Class.
- `CharField`, or Character Field, is for storing limited number of characters.
- `TextField` is for storing long text.
- `ForeignKey` is for linking this model to other model.

## Creating Migration

Once your model is changed, you need to create migration.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations home
python manage.py migrate
```

The first one is to create the diff file. The second one is to apply the change. You must perform this every time a model is changed since database is a separate layer from the server.

## Django Admin

Django comes with admin so that you can manage all the data stored in your website. First, register your Dog to the admin.

```python
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Dog

admin.site.register(Dog)
```

Then, create a super user.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Then, go to the admin page here at `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

After you log in, you can see Groups, Users, and Dogs! Groups and Users are created by default. If you go to Users, you can see one user registered to the website. The superuser!

## Creating a blog

You can totally create a static website simply using html, css, view, and url, but by using model, your website can be a lot more dynamic. The simple dynamic website you can create is a blog.

### Creating a new app

You can create blog related models in your default app, but it's a lot more cleaner if you have a separate app.

```bash
python manage.py startapp post
```

### Register app in the settings

Even after creating an app, it won't be applied to your website unless you add it to the installed app.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'home',
    'post',
]
```

### Create views for displaying a blog post

This is where you create html and css and modify urls and views.

```html
<!-- mysite/post/templates/post/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Blog Title</h2>
      <p>This is where the blog entry goes.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's leave the content blank for now. The title and the content are just placeholder.

```python
# mysite/post/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render


def index(request):
    return render(request, "post/index.html", {})
```

Create a view that renders the page you created.

```python
# mysite/mysite/urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'', include('home.urls')),
    url(r'^blog/', include('post.urls')),
]
```

Add `post.urls` to the url settings. By adding `'r^blog/'`, all routes that have blog will be handled by this app.

```python
# mysite/post/urls.py
from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

Since app doesn't have urls by default, we need to create one.

Now confirm that the page is correctly displayed in `http://localhost:8000/blog/`.

# Creating model and registering to admin

Now, create the Post model.

```python
# mysite/post/models.py
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone


class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    text = models.TextField()
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(
            default=timezone.now)
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(
            blank=True, null=True)
```

Register this to admin.

```python
# mysite/post/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```

Now migrate.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations post
python manage.py migrate
```

Go check it in the admin. For testing purpose, let's create two sample posts.

## Loading Model in View

Since model represents data and you want to render those data in your html, it's time to change view so that it displays posts.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

def index(request):
    print Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, "post/index.html", {})
```

If you see the message printed there, you can see the list of Post objects.

```bash
[<Post: Post object>, <Post: Post object>]
```

Let's pass all those posts to html so that it can handle the rendering.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

def index(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, "post/index.html", {'posts': posts})
```

And all you need to do in your html is the following.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      {% for post in posts %}
        <div>
          <h2><a href="">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
          <p>{{ post.text }}</p>
        </div>
      {% endfor %}
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

For is used to iterate list. Every time you create a post in admin, it will be shown in your website.
