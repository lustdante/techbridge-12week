# 7. Bootstrap Introduction

This chapter introduces how to use Bootstrap to easily and effectively create website.

## Goal

Using Bootstrap, create basic landing page and sign up page.

## Bootstrap? What's that?

Bootstrap is a `Frontend Framework` that makes website building a lot easier. Here is the list of other popular CSS frameworks.

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)

In short, it's a lot of javascript and css scripts prepared for you.

## Why Framework?

- Responsive
- Saves a lot of time
- Instead of using javascript and css to build everything, you only have to use the framework to do complicated tasks

> javascript and css are still used for detailed works

## Why Bootstrap?

Factors to consider when choosing framework

- Popularity
- Active Development
- Good Documentation
- Taste

We will make use of all [these](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/).

## Starting with template.

This is the file you should start with when making any page.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Starter Template for Bootstrap</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

```

### What is CDN?

It's a really generous server put up libraries for the public to use.

```html
<!-- Load bootstrap css file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<!-- Load jquery javascript file -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<!-- Load bootstrap javascript file -->
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

## Helper CSS

Disclaimer: it's easier to add extra class in html than editing extra line in css.

- pull-left, pull-right
- clearfix
- hidden
- etc.

## Grid

Remember how many of the website design involves stacking boxes horizontally? Bootstrap's Grid makes it a breeze.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">.col-sm-4</div>
  <div class="col-sm-8">.col-sm-8</div>
</div>
```

All you need to do is find a way to split the number 12.

So, I get that col stands for column is number is the ratio. What is sm?

Here is the full list
- xs
- sm
- md
- lg

This is the responsive power of Bootstrap. If you want three columns in desktop but single column in mobile, Grid takes care of it all!

## Jumbotron

## Button

## Button Group

## List Group

## Panel

## Dropdown
