# 5. HTML and CSS I

After having gone through introduction for html and css, we now go deeper with designing a website using these two.

## HTML and CSS Review

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My first web page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My first web page</h1>
    <p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>
    <p class="underline">Let's learn HTML and what not</p>
</body>
</html>
```

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 48px;
  color: red;
}
p {
  font-family: Verdana;
}
.underline {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### HTML Tags

This is the list of html tags we have covered so far
- html
- head
- body
- title
- meta
- link
- h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
- p
- ol, ul, li

### CSS Selectors

- color
- font-family
- font-size
- font-weight
- font-style
- text-decoration

You may possibly wonder what we can do just with this.

## Table Element

Table at its core is the best way to show a lot of data, but it can be utilized to server many purposes.

It's just bunch of elements with a lot of depth.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>First</th>
      <th>Second</th>
      <th>Third</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
  </tobdy>
</table>
```

Table can be very difficult to read.

## Div and Span

To be honest, forget all other elements we taught you: 90% of elements that are used in the website is either div or span.

```html
<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
<div>3</div>
<span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
```

So, what exactly is div and span? They are... the purest form of element. If you use Chrome Debugger Tool, you can see that header and paragraph tags have default styles whereas div and span don't have any.

Header's purpose is to display the title of the page. Paragraph's purpose is to display content of the page. Like that, most of the elements have their purpose.

Except div and span. You are the one who decide what to do with div and span, which is why most of the time, they come with class attributes.

The only noticeable difference between div and span is that spans stack in one sentence while divs get the whole width for themselves. That's because of the display style.

```css
div {
  display: block;
}
```

Span is for defining custom element that goes with text. Everything else is div.

## Styling div

Let's make boxes with div. After all, all websites are just a collection of different sized and styled boxes.

```html
<div class="box1">
  <div class="content1"></div>
  <div class="content2"></div>
</div>
<div class="box2">
  <div class="content1"></div>
  <div class="content2"></div>
</div>
<div class="box3">
  <div class="content1"></div>
  <div class="content2"></div>
</div>
```

These are three div elements with unique class name and no content. It looks pretty empty as well.

### Width, Height, and Background Color

Well, these are what you need to tell the difference between three empty divs.

```css
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
.box2 {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: yellow;
}
.box3 {
  height: 300px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

Da-da, three stacked boxes. Notice that defining no width will make its width `auto`. Type `css width` in Google and you can see what it does including the default value. [Link](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp)

Let's also style contents

```css
.content1 {
  width: 40%;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: gray;
}
.content2 {
  width: 60%;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: darkgray;
}

```

### Border

While at it, let's give them cool borders.

```css
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
.box2 {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 2px dashed black;
}
.box3 {
  height: 300px;
  background-color: blue;
  border: 5px solid purple;
}
```

### Margin

Let's put some distance between boxes

```css
.box1, .box2, .box3 {
  margin: 10px;
}
```

Wow, that applies margins in all four directions. I only want margin at the bottom.

```css
.box1, .box2, .box3 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

Now you notice the white areas around the whole page. That's because body also has margin by default. Let's kill that.

```css
body {
  margin: 0px;
}
```

### Padding

Let's put some distance inside boxes

```css
.box1, .box2, .box3 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

This should be good enough to tell the difference between padding and margin.
